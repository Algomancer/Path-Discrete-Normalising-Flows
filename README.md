# PathNF-SDE

discrete normalizing flow meets stochastic differential equation. trains on some trajectory data, learns to generate new ones.

## what

latent space is diagonal OU (mean-reverting noise where each dimension does its own thing independently). flow is time-conditioned RealNVP. path-wise MLE.

*idk just seemed like a cool idea*
